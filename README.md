# PostgreSQL-Notes

## Multiple Column Queries
When multiple conditions are supplied in the query, the planner assumes that the columns (or the where clause conditions) are independent of each other. This doesnâ€™t hold true when columns are correlated or dependant on each other and that leads the planner to under or over-estimate the number of rows which will be returned by these conditions.<br>

## Query Time Taken
```SQL
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl where col1 = 1;
```
#### Result:
```SQL
Seq Scan on tbl  (cost=0.00..169247.80 rows=9584 width=8) (actual time=0.641..622.851 rows=10000 loops=1)
   Filter: (col1 = 1)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 9990000
 Planning time: 0.051 ms
 Execution time: 623.185 ms
(5 rows)
```
## Create Statistics
### Dependencies
```SQL
CREATE STATISTICS s1 (dependencies) on col1, col2 from tbl;
ANALYZE tbl;
```
### Combination Distinct Values
```SQL
CREATE STATISTICS s2 (ndistinct) on col1, col2 from tbl;
ANALYZE tbl;
```

## Check for dependecies
```SQL
SELECT stxname, stxkeys, stxdependencies
  FROM pg_statistic_ext
  WHERE stxname = 's1';
```
#### Result
``` SQL
stxname | stxkeys |   stxdependencies
---------+---------+----------------------
 s1      | 1 2     | {"1 => 2": 1.000000}
(1 row)
```
