# PostgreSQL-Notes

## Multiple Column Queries
When multiple conditions are supplied in the query, the planner assumes that the columns (or the where clause conditions) are independent of each other. This doesnâ€™t hold true when columns are correlated or dependant on each other and that leads the planner to under or over-estimate the number of rows which will be returned by these conditions.<br>
